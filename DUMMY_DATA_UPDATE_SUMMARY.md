# Dummy Data Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the PlasTech app's dummy data to reflect real transaction data provided by the user. The data covers recycling activities for August 22-23, 2025.

## Updated Files

### 1. DummyDataGenerator.java
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/qppd/plastech/utils/DummyDataGenerator.java`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `generateDummyHistoricalData()` to generate data only for August 22-23, 2025
- Completely rewrote `generateDataForDate()` method to use real transaction data instead of random generation
- Updated `generateTodaysData()` to use August 23, 2025 as the current date

**Real Data Integration**:
- **August 22, 2025**: 16 individual transactions aggregated to 7 large bottles, 9 small bottles, 467g total weight, ₱16.00 rewards
- **August 23, 2025**: 13 individual transactions aggregated to 7 large bottles, 6 small bottles, 400g total weight, ₱13.00 rewards

### 2. HomeViewModel.java  
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/qppd/plastech/ui/home/HomeViewModel.java`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `loadDummyRecentActivities()` to show actual recent recycling activities from August 23, 2025
- Updated `loadDummyEarnings()` to reflect real earnings: ₱29.00 total, ₱13.00 today
- Updated `loadDummyNotifications()` to show relevant notifications about real earnings

## Data Aggregation Logic

### From Individual Transactions to Daily Summary:
The provided individual transaction data was aggregated using this logic:

1. **Count bottles by size**: Large vs Small based on dimensions
2. **Sum weights**: Total weight of all bottles per day  
3. **Sum rewards**: ₱1.00 per transaction
4. **Calculate bin level**: Based on bottle count relative to capacity
5. **Calculate coin stock**: Simulation of available coins for rewards

### Transaction Data Summary:

#### August 22, 2025 (16 transactions):
- **Time Range**: 8:05 AM - 10:19 AM
- **Large Bottles**: 7 (dimensions 9.5"×9", 10"×9", 9.4"×8", 9"×8.5", 9.5"×9", 9.8"×8.7")  
- **Small Bottles**: 9 (dimensions 5"×5", 6.6"×6", 5.5"×5", 5.6"×5", 6.7"×5", 6.4"×5")
- **Total Weight**: 467g
- **Total Rewards**: ₱16.00

#### August 23, 2025 (13 transactions):
- **Time Range**: 9:34 AM - 12:33 PM  
- **Large Bottles**: 7 (dimensions 9.5"×8", 9.5"×9", 10"×8, 8.4"×8", 9.5"×9", 9.9×8", 8.7×9")
- **Small Bottles**: 6 (dimensions 5"×5", 6.5'×5", 5.5"×5", 5.5"×5", 5.7"×5", 7.2"×6")
- **Total Weight**: 400g  
- **Total Rewards**: ₱13.00

## Firebase Structure Maintained

The existing Firebase Realtime Database structure under `bin_history/` is preserved:
```
plastech/
└── bin_history/
    ├── 2025-08-22/
    └── 2025-08-23/
```

Each daily entry contains:
- `date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp  
- `bottle_large`: Count of large bottles
- `bottle_small`: Count of small bottles
- `bin_level`: Calculated fill percentage
- `total_rewards`: Total earnings for the day
- `total_weight`: Total weight in grams
- `coin_stock`: Available coins for rewards
- `status`: Operational status ("normal", "high", "low")

## UI Impact

### Home Fragment:
- Recent activities now show last 3 real recycling transactions from August 23
- Earnings widget displays real totals: ₱29.00 lifetime, ₱13.00 today
- User level updated to "Eco Beginner" (29% progress to ₱100 milestone)
- Notifications updated to reflect real earnings

### Monitor Fragment:
- Historical data chart will show real data points for August 22-23, 2025
- Daily statistics reflect actual bottle counts and weights

## Notes
- Individual transaction timestamps and dimensions are preserved in comments for reference
- The "H and W after crushing" column was empty in provided data, so it's not used
- All rewards are standardized at ₱1.00 per transaction as provided
- Bin levels and coin stock are calculated using realistic simulation logic
